##BUSINESS INFORMATION
Baruch Performing Arts Center (BPAC) is a part of the Baruch College community. It has four venues and an average of 600 shows in total each year. An event management database designed by the Baruch IT department is currently in use.

Due to insufficient design of the database, not enough information is included in the DBMS. The staff has to go to 3 other separate places (Local server, Google Drive, and paper file folder) to gather all information needed for a show. The work efficiency is sacrificed and the morale stays low. This project aims to design a replacement event management system for BPAC to include all the information.
